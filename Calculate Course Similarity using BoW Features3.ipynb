is one of the most exciting areas of technology at the moment  we see daily news stories that herald new breakthroughs in facial recognition technology  self driving cars or computers that can have a conversation just like a real person  machine learning technology is set to revolutionise almost any area of human life and work  and so will affect all our lives  and so you are likely to want to find out more about it  machine learning has a reputation for being one of the most complex areas of computer science  requiring advanced mathematics and engineering skills to understand it  while it is true that working as a machine learning engineer does involve a lot of mathematics and programming  we believe that anyone can understand the basic concepts of machine learning  and given the importance of this technology  everyone should  the big ai breakthroughs sound like science fiction  but they come down to a simple idea  the use of data to train statistical algorithms  in this course you will learn to understand the basic idea of machine learning  even if you don t have any background in math or programming  not only that  you will get hands on and use user friendly tools developed at goldsmiths  university of london to actually do a machine learning project  training a computer to recognise images  this course is for a lot of different people  it could be a good first step into a technical career in machine learning  after all it is always better to start with the high level concepts before the technical details  but it is also great if your role is non technical  you might be a manager or other non technical role in a company that is considering using machine learning  you really need to understand this technology  and this course is a great place to get that understanding  or you might just be following the news reports about ai and interested in finding out more about the hottest new technology of the moment  whoever you are  we are looking forward to guiding you through you first machine learning project \n","\n","nb this course is designed to introduce you to machine learning without needing any programming  that means that we don t cover the programming based machine learning tools like python and tensorflow    \n","introduction to machine learning    this course will provide you a foundational understanding of machine learning models  logistic regression  multilayer perceptrons  convolutional neural networks  natural language processing  etc   as well as demonstrate how these models can solve complex problems in a variety of industries  from medical diagnostics to image recognition to text prediction  in addition  we have designed practice exercises that will give you hands on experience implementing these data science models on data sets  these practice exercises will teach you how to implement machine learning algorithms with pytorch  open source libraries used by leading tech companies in the machine learning field  e g   google  nvidia  cocacola  ebay  snapchat  uber and many more \n","Similarity: 0.63\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Course ID: excourse46\n","Title: machine learning\n","Description: machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed  in the past decade  machine learning has given us self driving cars  practical speech recognition  effective web search  and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome  machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it  many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human level ai  in this class  you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques  and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself  more importantly  you ll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning  but also gain the practical know how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems  finally  you ll learn about some of silicon valley s best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and ai \n","\n","this course provides a broad introduction to machine learning  datamining  and statistical pattern recognition  topics include   i  supervised learning  parametric non parametric algorithms  support vector machines  kernels  neural networks    ii  unsupervised learning  clustering  dimensionality reduction  recommender systems  deep learning    iii  best practices in machine learning  bias variance theory  innovation process in machine learning and ai   the course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications  so that you ll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots  perception  control   text understanding  web search  anti spam   computer vision  medical informatics  audio  database mining  and other areas\n","Similarity:
